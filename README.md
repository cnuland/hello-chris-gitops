# Hello Chris
A generic ci/cd pipeline for use in DevOps projects. This version pulls k8s/ocp resources down from a git repository and runs an `oc apply -fR` recursively for all directories. This is a way of applying a basic gitops pattern using jenkins within a cluster.

Feel free to pull, modify, etc
